# src/swarmbus/topics.py
"""Single source of truth for swarmbus MQTT topic strings.

Every topic the bus publishes to, subscribes to, or parses is built and
parsed here. Two independent clients (``AgentBus`` in ``bus.py`` and
``ManagedMCPRuntime`` in ``runtime.py``) speak the same wire layout; before
this module they each carried their own string literals, and the literals
drifted.

Layout (with the default empty root, i.e. exactly what the bus speaks today)::

    agents/<agent_id>/inbox        directed messages
    agents/<agent_id>/presence     retained online/offline, also the LWT
    agents/broadcast               bus-wide fan-out
    swarmbus/registry/<agent_id>   retained registry record + heartbeat

A non-empty ``root`` prefixes the agent and registry trees, e.g.
``TopicMap(root="loom")`` yields ``loom/agents/wren/inbox`` and
``loom/swarmbus/registry/wren``.

``broadcast`` is DELIBERATELY NOT ROOTED. Broadcasts are bus-wide by
design: every agent on the broker sees them regardless of which namespace
it lives under. Do not "fix" this asymmetry.

Parsing rules
-------------
Every parser here RAISES ``ValueError`` on a topic that does not match the
expected shape. This is not defensive padding -- it is the whole point of
the module. The code this replaced used
``topic.removeprefix("agents/").removesuffix("/presence")``, and
``str.removeprefix`` returns the string UNCHANGED when the prefix is
absent, so a non-matching topic yielded a plausible-looking wrong agent id
instead of an error. With a root in play, ``loom/agents/x/presence`` would
have parsed to an agent id of ``loom/agents/x`` -- silently, forever.
See the comments on the parsers below before touching them.
